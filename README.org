#+title: Tempel Snippets - Rudimentary YASnippet Translation

#+html: <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Greek_Script_from_Rosetta_Stone_%2836140196440%29.jpg/640px-Greek_Script_from_Rosetta_Stone_%2836140196440%29.jpg" align="right" width="30%">

Tempel Snippets is an effort on translating [[https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet][YASnippet]] snippets to the [[https://github.com/minad/tempel][Tempel]] format,
using [[https://github.com/Crandel/tempel-collection][tempel-collection]] as its core implementation (the =.el= file).
Some of the earlier snippets were translated using GPT-4O (I got the hang of Tempel's syntax after some time), and tested and tweaked by me.

* Configuration

I'll only consider uploading this package when I'm sure that any issues are fixed.
If you want to install it, consider using a source-based package manager, such as [[https://github.com/progfolio/elpaca][elpaca]],
or the newer ~package-vc-install~, included as of Emacs 30+.
Below are ~use-package~ example configurations for Tempel, aswell as different ways of installing this package.

** ~package-vc-install~

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package tempel
    :bind
    ("C-c i s" . tempel-insert)
    :ensure t)

  (use-package tempel-snippets
    :after tempel
    :vc (:url "https://github.com/gs-101/tempel-snippets")
    :ensure t)
#+end_src

** [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][Straight]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package tempel
    :bind
    ("C-c i s" . tempel-insert)
    :ensure t)

  (use-package tempel-snippets
    :straight (tempel-snippets :host github :repo "gs-101/tempel-snippets")
    :after tempel
    :ensure t)
#+end_src

** [[https://github.com/progfolio/elpaca][Elpaca]]

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (elpaca elpaca-use-package
          (elpaca-use-package-mode))

  (use-package tempel
    :bind
    ("C-c i s" . tempel-insert)
    :ensure t)

  (use-package tempel-snippets
    :host github :repo "gs-101/tempel-snippets"
    :after tempel
    :ensure t)
#+end_src

* Comparison

So, how does this package differ from the existing [[https://github.com/Crandel/tempel-collection][tempel-collection]]?

1. This package is meant to be a plain translation of [[https://github.com/AndreaCrotti/yasnippet-snippets][YASnippet Snippets]], not introducing any new snippets
2. Template names are based on the original snippet's keys, so there might be some [[https://github.com/Crandel/tempel-collection/pull/61#discussion_r1741429831][conflicts]] with autocompletion
   - Manual inseartion is recommended, as is demonstrated on the configuration example
3. Since this is directly based on YASnippet Snippets, more modes and snippets are included, since it's an older project

* Known Issues

** Functionality

- I haven't used YASnippet prior to working on this, so some functionality might differ from the original.
- I don't have experience with all the modes included, so there might be some issues with the snippets I couldn't catch.
- Parent snippets such as [[./snippets/c-lang-common.eld][c-lang-common]] currently have no implementation.

** Indentation

There's some issues with indentation, specially in the insertion of brackets.
